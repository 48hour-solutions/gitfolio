## GitFolio ✨

An AI-powered portfolio generator for your GitHub profile 🚀

### **Profile Overview 🧾📊**

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narrative Professional Summary** 📝 | An advanced AI analyzes a developer's entire public footprint—code, commit patterns, and repository themes—to generate a professional, narrative-style summary that reads like a high-quality bio. |
| **Holistic Developer Score** 💯 | A unique "Developer Score" (0-100) is calculated to holistically evaluate a profile's impact, considering commit activity, repository quality, and community validation (stars/forks). The score is fully auditable with a detailed breakdown. |
| **Automated Skill & Language Analysis** 🧠 | The AI goes beyond simply listing languages. It infers high-level skills (e.g., "API Design," "Game Development") from repository content and provides concise insights into the developer's demonstrated experience with their top languages. |
| **Intelligent Data Aggregation** 🧹 | The system intelligently processes all of a user's repositories, filtering out forked projects and non-programming languages (e.g., Markdown, CSS) to provide clean, meaningful statistics on their original work. |

### **Developer Search 🔍🎯**

A powerful tool for recruiters and team leads to find ideal candidates within the GitFolio database.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- |:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Natural Language Search Engine** 💬 | Go beyond simple keyword matching. Users can describe their ideal candidate in conversational language (e.g., "Find me a Python developer who has worked with automation tools and has experience with tensorflow"). |
| **AI-Driven Candidate Ranking** 🏆 | A multi-stage AI pipeline first extracts key technical concepts from the query, then analyzes and ranks the most suitable candidates from the entire database. |
| **Personalized Match Reasoning** 🤔 | For each search result, the AI provides a concise, one-sentence justification explaining *why* the candidate is a strong match, citing specific skills or project experience relevant to the original query. |

### **Professional Export & Sharing 🚀📤**

GitFolio provides tangible assets that can be used in portfolios, resumes, and professional profiles.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Self-Contained HTML Export** 📄 | Download a profile as a single, fully interactive HTML file. All styling, data, and even pop-up dialogs are preserved, creating a perfect offline artifact for a portfolio or to send to recruiters. |
| **GitHub-Ready Markdown Generation** 📝 | Generate a complete, well-structured Markdown report of the profile, perfect for pasting directly into a `README.md`. The tool includes a live preview and a one-click copy button. |
| **Clean, Shareable Profile URLs** 🔗 | Every generated profile is accessible via a clean, semantic URL (`/username`), making it simple to share a live, always-up-to-date professional summary. |
